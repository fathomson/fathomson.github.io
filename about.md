Well as you might have noticed I am Frank Thomson and working as Data Scientist at ICT Automatisering. I am working on several interesting projects often involving a lot of data. Part of the knowledge gained during work I apply to hobby projects, which you can find here. Of course this also works the other way around.

### More Information

When I am not behind my desk I like to participate in road racing events (with bikes) and have a decent meal afterwards.

### Contact me

The best way to contact me is thought linkedin.
